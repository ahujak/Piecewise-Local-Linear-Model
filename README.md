# Piecewise Local Linear Model
In this project, we provide a method to construct piecewise local linear approximations of a black box model. The main idea behind building piecewise approximations is to divide the feature space into homogeneous regions and explain the model behavior locally in terms of a linear model. This work is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10270.pdf
