# Piecewise Local Linear Model
In this project, we provide a method to construct piecewise local linear approximations of a black box model. The main idea behind building piecewise approximations is to divide the feature space into homogeneous regions and explain the model behavior locally in terms of a linear model. This work is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10270.pdf
## piecewise_model_new class

### Parameters:
K: integer, number of intervals to partition the f's range 
model_type = "linear" for a piecewise linear approximation and model_type = "constant" for a piecewise constant approximation
delta = 1 (Default)
black_box = black box model (here model's from sklearn are permitted)
